>**Particl** creates technological solutions that shift the balance of power from monopoly-like organizations to you.

**Particl Marketplace** is a one-of-a-kind e-commerce platform that lets you buy and sell goods and services online with nobody in between. It’s just you and the other person you’re dealing with. There’s no company operating, controlling, or benefiting from the marketplace.

Unlike Amazon, eBay, or any other in-betweens, it is built with core security and privacy principles that keep you and your data safe at all times.

That means, just using Particl Marketplace helps you prevent being treated as an exploited product. Without additional efforts, like casually, you contribute to the well-being of our society by directly supporting individuals and small businesses all across the world, not corporations.

Stand for fairness for consumers, equal opportunity for merchants and vendors, and freedom for all people. Let others not take control of you.

***Give it a try; you’ll fall in love with it!***

* You benefit from lower product prices as a customer and higher margins as a vendor.
* You protect your privacy to avoid identity theft and data leaks.
* You become the captain of your personal information.
* You gain immunity against online fraud.
* You can’t get restricted.
* You say goodbye to spam and unwarranted solicitations.
* You fight against global economic and social inequalities.

Advanced and easy-to-use technology empowers you, your local economy, but not the corporate monopolies that prey on it. Feel like a hero fighting our generation’s most powerful villains!
